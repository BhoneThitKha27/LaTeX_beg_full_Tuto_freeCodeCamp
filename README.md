Over the course of these tutorials, I’ve built a strong foundation in using LaTeX as a typesetting system, particularly for writing technical and scientific documents such as theses, reports, and academic articles.

I began by understanding the structure of a LaTeX document, including key elements such as:

    \documentclass

    \begin{document} and \end{document}

    The use of packages via \usepackage

I learned how to format text professionally, including:

    Applying bold (\textbf{}), italics (\textit{}), and underline (\underline{})

    Managing font sizes and line spacing

    Creating custom titles, authors, and dates using \title{}, \author{}, and \date{}

One of the most valuable parts was learning how to handle sections, subsections, and table of contents efficiently. I also got comfortable with lists—both ordered and unordered—and nesting them where necessary.

A major focus was on mathematical typesetting, which is one of LaTeX's strongest features. I now understand:

    Inline math using $...$

    Display math using \[...\] and equation environments

    Using symbols like Greek letters, fractions, square roots, integrals, and matrices

I explored tables and figures, learning how to:

    Create complex tables using the tabular environment

    Adjust column alignment, borders, and spacing

    Insert images with the graphicx package and control their size/position

The tutorials also covered bibliography management, where I learned to:

    Add references manually using the thebibliography environment

    Cite them with \cite{} and format them to different styles

    Link with .bib files and use BibTeX for automation

Lastly, I picked up valuable tips for writing a thesis or long report, like:

    Splitting content into multiple .tex files

    Using the \input{} and \include{} commands

    Keeping formatting consistent and automated
